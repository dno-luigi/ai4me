# Pushing to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your AI4ME Chat Interface repository to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "ai4me-chat")
5. Add a description (optional): "A modern, feature-rich chat interface for AI communication using OpenRouter's API"
6. Choose visibility (public or private)
7. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (as we've already created these locally)
8. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

GitHub will provide instructions after repository creation. Use the "push an existing repository" instructions.

Run these commands in your terminal (replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username and `ai4me-chat` with your chosen repository name):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai4me-chat.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the Repository

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository URL to ensure all files were uploaded successfully.

## 4. Additional Setup (Optional)

Consider adding:
- GitHub Pages for a live demo
- Issues templates
- Workflow actions
- Contributor guidelines

## 5. Update package.json

After creating your repository, update the repository URL in package.json to match your actual GitHub repository:

```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/ai4me-chat.git"
}
```
