# Implementation Plan for AI System

## 1. Dynamic Configuration Module
### Tasks:
- **Define Configuration Structure**:
  - Create a configuration object to hold user and system preferences.
  
- **Implement Load/Save Functions**:
  - Develop functions to load preferences from local storage and save updates.
  
- **Create Update Functionality**:
  - Implement a function to update preferences dynamically based on user input.

## 2. Memory Management Module
### Tasks:
- **Interest Detection**:
  - Develop functions to analyze user input and detect interests/preferences.
  
- **Memory Storage**:
  - Implement functions to save and retrieve user interests/preferences from local storage.
  
- **User Feedback Mechanism**:
  - Create a system for users to confirm or adjust detected preferences.

## 3. User Interface Design
### Tasks:
- **Dynamic Configuration UI**:
  - Design a user-friendly interface for managing display settings, themes, and other preferences.
  
- **Memory Management UI**:
  - Create an interface for users to view and manage their interests/preferences.

## 4. Integration
### Tasks:
- Ensure that both modules interact seamlessly, allowing user preferences to influence memory behavior and vice versa.

## Prioritization
- Prioritize tasks based on user needs and technical feasibility, starting with the dynamic configuration module followed by memory management and UI design.
